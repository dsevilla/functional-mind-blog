After some hacking, I've been able to modify the wonderful Deft mode
by Jason R. Blevins to support several directories. I had my notes
divided in several directories, including my TO-DO entries, and I
thought it would be nice to give Deft the possibility to support
several directories, and at the same time, an exercise for my Emacs
Lisp.

I tried to make the least modifications as possible to the original
source, so that the change can be made with a patch, if the original
author considers it (this is also why I didn't change the name of the
mode either.) You can download it, and read instructions of
installation and usage here:

As always, feedback is highly appreciated.
