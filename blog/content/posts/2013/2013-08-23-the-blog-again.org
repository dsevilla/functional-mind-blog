Well, after almost a year, I would like to continue writting in my
blog. Let's see if this time I keep it up to date. I just added a
"status" tag to each post. I wanted to add this time ago to maintain
long, unfinished things while the blog gets unaffected. I have a lot
of pending things to include in the blog. I will be updating it
periodically. I promise.
